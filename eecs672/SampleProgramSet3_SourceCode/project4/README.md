# PUBG Cargo Air Drops

### Change Log
* From Project 3 Review:
  * Implement `vHat` for oblique projections
  * Detect projection type by looking at the `ec_lds` matrix instead of passing another uniform to the fragment shader
* Added texture mapping feature to:
  * `Ground` element displays grass texture from `images/ground-texture.jpg`
  * `Building` elements displays brick texture from `images/bricks.png`
