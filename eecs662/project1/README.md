# Project 0 - A First Interpreter

The first objective of this miniproject is to develop your first type checker. You will start with the ABE language presented in class and develop techniques for predicting failure. The second objective is developing a trivial optimizer that removes constants in + and if expressions.

## Running the Test

Load the file:
```
ghci p1.hs
```

Run the QuickCheck test (e.g. 100 different test runs)
```
testTypedEval 100
```

## Project Requirements

To aid in your quest, the file p1.hs implements the Haskell ABE and TABE data types, function signatures, and a parser from strings to the ABE data type. You do not need the parser for this project. It is included if you find the concrete syntax easier to read and to give you another example using Parsec.

### Exercise 1
Write a parser and interpreter for the ABE language discussed in class and presented in our text extended to include multiplication and division. Work with the parser that is defined in the example from class.

```haskell
ABE ::= number | boolean
        ABE + ABE |
        ABE - ABE |
        ABE * ABE |
        ABE / ABE |
        ABE && ABE |
        ABE <= ABE |
        isZero ABE |
        if ABE then ABE else ABE
```

1. Write a function, `evalM :: ABE -> (Maybe ABE)`, that takes a `ABE` data structure and interprets it and returns an `ABE` value or nothing. Your `eval` function should only check for divide-by-zero errors and negative numbers at run-time.
2. Write a function, `evalErr :: ABE -> (Maybe ABE)`, that takes a `ABE` data structure and interprets it and returns an `ABE` value or nothing. Your 4. evalErr function should do full run-time type checking in addition to divide-by-zero and negative number checking.
3. Write a function, `typeofM :: ABE -> (Maybe TABE)`, that returns either Nothing representing an error or an `TABE` value representing a type.
4. Write a function, evalTypeM that combines `typeM` and `evalM` into a single operation that type checks and evaluates an `ABE` expression. Take advantage of the `Maybe` monad to ensure `evalM` is not called when `typeofM` fails.

### Exercise 2
And now, something completely different. Remembering that programs are just data structures, write a new function called `optimize :: ABE -> ABE` that does two things:

1. If the expression `x + 0` appears in an expression, replace it with `x`.
2. If the expression `if true then x else y` appears in an expression, replace it with `x`. Similarly for `false` and `y`.

Write a new function, `interpOptM::ABE -> Maybe ABE`, that integrates your new optimize into your `ABE` interpreter by calling it right before `evalM`.

Do not make this harder than it is. The optimizer replaces literal `0` in addition and literal `true` and `false` in the `if`. Thatâ€™s all. Nothing else.
